# Kernel version to use (see: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building)
# Set to "kernel" to target all RPi versions in 32-bit; or more specifically:
# Set to "kernel" to target 32-bit for RPi1 & PRi0, Rpi0 W
# Set to "kernel7" to target 32-bit for RPi2, RPi3, RPi3+, and RPi0 2 W
# Set to "kernel7l" to target 32-bit for RPi4
# Set to "kernel8" to target 64-bit for RPi2, RPi3, RPi3+, and RPi0 2 W
# Set to "kernel_2712" to target RPi5
#KERNELNEEDED=kernel
KERNELNEEDED=kernel7

# ARM version to build for
# Set to "armv6" to target all RPi versions.
# In THEORY the following should work also: 
# Set to "armv7" to target 32-bit for RPi2, RPi3, RPi3+, RPi4, and RPi0 2 W
# Set to "armv8" to target 64-bit for RPi2, RPi3, RPi3+, RPiv4 and RPi0 2 W
# But these other ARMARCH setting DO NOT WORK (at least for me).  Stick to "armv6"
#ARMARCH=armv6
